## üîç Context & Stakes

Hospitals and public health programs relied on fragmented, outdated systems ‚Äî leading to missed appointments, compliance gaps, and staff burnout.

**Workflow Fragmentation:**
- **Doctors** ‚Üí appointment scheduling inside EHRs
- **Nurses** ‚Üí paper logs + shift notes  
- **Admins** ‚Üí Excel sheets for revenue forecasting

**The Result:** 60% of staff time lost to context switching, 40% of "urgent" messages were noise, and high administrative burden caused compliance gaps and delayed patient care.

## üß† Problem Statement & Research

### Core Problem

Hospitals and WIC programs were relying on **outdated, siloed tools**:

- Messages scattered across multiple channels
- Appointment scheduling required **manual reconciliation**
- Compliance notifications buried in dropdowns

The result: **missed appointments, delayed responses, and staff burnout**.

### Research Process

I led a structured discovery process designed to capture **quantitative task data** and **qualitative user sentiment**:

1. **Contextual Inquiry:** Shadowed 12 clinic admins and 6 nurses across 3 facilities to observe real workflows
2. **Task Analysis:** Logged over 3,000 daily tasks, identifying friction points in communication, scheduling, and compliance
3. **User Interviews:** Conducted structured interviews with staff, focusing on trust in technology, perceptions of AI, and pain points in their existing EHR
4. **Usability Testing:** Ran 3 iterative rounds with low- and mid-fidelity prototypes, validating navigation clarity and AI interpretability
5. **Stakeholder Workshops:** Facilitated sessions with state agency leaders to align product goals with regulatory and reporting needs

### Key Insights

- **60% of staff time lost** to context switching across multiple systems
- **40% of "urgent" messages were noise**, undermining trust in alerts
- Staff wanted **AI augmentation, not automation** ‚Äî requiring transparency and control
- High administrative burden caused **compliance gaps** and **delayed patient care**
